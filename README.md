# Face and smile detector
Just a simple python script for detecting faces and smiles using the openCV library. The main purpose of this program was to test the openCV VideoCapture function with the "IP Camera" app on my Android phone. The face and smile detection models are not mine.

This script has been tested with the following IP camera apps:
  - "IP Webcam" by Pavel Khlebovich (Android): https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pas.webcam (v1.1)
  - "IP Webcam Home Security Camera" by Ehsan Tahzeeb (iOS): https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ip-webcam-home-security-camera/id1264454867
